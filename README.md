# Investo
Just a program that I use to gather data on stocks. Less of an investing program, meant to be used to gather data on how companies of different types react to different events. Kinda like a web crawler or somethin.  Not Financial advice, meant for educational uses only.

IMPORTANT INFO: None of the data in the program is encrypted nor protected, and it shouldn't be, as all of it with the exception of your api key (learn about that later) is publicly available. This is just a tool for getting public data faster.
